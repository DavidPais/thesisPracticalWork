Part II - Dimensionality reduction algorithms [READ ME]:

This folder contains the pratical work regarding the second part of the student's dissertation work, applying dimensionality reduction methods.

It contains the processing of the mice and TCGA data input, the tables that will be input to the script where it will be run the dimensionlity reduction algorithms,
the file with the the methods applied, and 3 folders with the output corresponding to the application of the methods:


[folder] Input: The processing of the input dataframes needed to apply the dimensionality reduction methods using both the mice case study and the TCGA patients data.

	[file] processInputCancerAnalysesFinalML: Receiving as input both the mice case study and the TCGA patients data, it processes the different input types 
	and finds the genes that are common to both the mice and the TCGA data. 

[folder] Output: Dimensionality reduction methods output code and plots.

	[file] cancerAnalysesFinalML.py: Different dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the data to further explore if the mice data are different
	from each other considering other features, in this case, the genes affected by SNVs and CNAs.

	[folder] 1 - miceSamplesPlotsOutput: Resulting plots of applying the dimensionality reduction algorithms to the mice case study data only.

	[folder] 2 - patientsTCGAPlotsOutput: Resulting plots of applying the dimensionality reduction algorithms to the TCGA patients data only.

	[folder] 3 - micePatientsTCGASamplesPlotsOutput: Resulting plots of applying the dimensionality reduction algorithms to both
	the mice case study and TCGA patients data together.
